P: You, dude, over there!
D: Huh, what?
P: I need you to descend this Well and retrieve my long lost family heirlooms.
D: Who are you?
P: I'm the owner of this estate.
D: But, this well is in the middle of barren swampland...
P: Yes, the evil that resides in this Well brought about my family's downfall over multiple generations and I am all that remains, etc. Regardless, I will give you half if you help me retrieve the treasure, uh, I mean, my family heirlooms.
D: Why would I trust you?
P: I have a hat.
D: Oh, OK.
P: We must hurry. Quick, attach yourself to this tether.
D: Why are we both walking on the spot?
P: Our creator didn't have time to give us idle animations only for this intro.
D: Creator? Intro? What are you...
P: That's not important right now, what matters is plundering the treasure I mean retrieving my family's long lost heirlooms.
D: Yes... sir...
